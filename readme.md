As Juno has grown, we need to become better at how we organize ourselves in a distributed way. To scale better, we're launching SubDAOs that will operate various functions for and on behalf of the Juno Community DAO.

NB: **Juno Community DAO** refers to Juno Chain Governance.

General Principles for SubDAOs
==============================

-   Anybody working on a SubDAO is an appointee who may be removed by the Juno Community DAO.
-   Funds assigned belong to the Juno Community DAO and may be recalled with a vote.
-   Actions taken by SubDAOs are on behalf of the Juno Community DAO.
-   SubDAO multisigs are wholly the purview of the Juno Community DAO.
-   SubDAOs can be created or dissolved at any time by the Juno Community DAO.
-   Official Juno SubDAOs must be instantiated by the Juno Community DAO.
-   Admin control must be given to the Juno Community DAO.

By voting **YES** on this proposal, you agree that:

-   SubDAOs should be established to manage Juno functions.
-   SubDAOs should operate under the principles outlined above.
-   The Juno Community DAO should have ultimate control over SubDAOs.
