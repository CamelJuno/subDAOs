## Budget request
With the following proposals, we are asking funding from the community pool to cover conference-related expenses. 

The conference season is about to begin, and we would like to participate in some as sponsors and in others as participants. We think that the presence of Juno in these conferences is important, asserting Juno as the leading CosmWasm blockchain in the Interchain Ecosystem and showing off all the good work being put by the Core Development team.

Here is a table of the upcoming conferences, we intend to support, and their corresponding budgeting :-


| Conference Name | Date | Location | Sponsor Budget | Comms Budget |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| AwesomWasm | July 12,13 | Berlin | 5,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| OsmoCon     | July 21     | Paris      | 15,000 USD  | 1,000 USD   |
| Nebular Hacker House | July 22, 23 | Paris | 5,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| Nebular Summit | July 24, 25 | Paris | 9,000 USD | 2,000 USD |
| HackWasm Italy | September 16th (tbc) | Italy | 8,000 USD | 0 USD |
| HackWasm Turkey | October 5,6 | Istanbul | 15,000 USD | 2,000 USD |

## Community Spend

*Pure sponsorships costs:* 57,000 USD
*Comms costs:* 9,000 USD (500 USD * Person * Day)

Comms Costs include the following
- Travel & Accommodation
- Equipment

*Total funding requested:* **66,000 USD** 

The funds will go to the Juno Communications SubDAO treasury. For spending purposes, tokens will be sold OTC (Over-the-Counter) or through low-volume-transaction swapping over DEXs when needed.
Juno Governance can always recall the funds back to the community pool.
Any unspent remaining funds will stay in the subDAO treasury for future usage.

## Note
Two conferences are already waiting for contract sign. Funds will not be converted in any way until the payment deadline is near, and the SubDAO might consider liquid stake the tokens meanwhile.

## How to vote
We are posting a total of 6 proposals, community is free to vote for each proposal to signal which conference we should support and which not. 

The prices for each conferences are already the best deal we could get with organizers, modifying the sponsor packages to best suit our needs.

Juno Communications SubDAO strongly suggest to support all the conferences listed above.

This specific proposal is signaling only to introduce the voting system. Voting against this proposal show that community don't want Communication SubDAO to work on conferences and events at all.
