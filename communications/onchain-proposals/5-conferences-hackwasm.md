# 5/6 Conferences budget - HackWasm Italy

This is the fifth proposal asking for conferences budget, specific for HackWasm Italy event.

## What is HackWasm Italy
HackWasm Italy will be a 48hrs hackathon organized by Juno in collaboration with local partners, including [Made in Block](https://twitter.com/madeinblock_), other validators and other Ecosystem Chains. 

Made In Block is already hosting Cosmos Meetups every month, partially self funded and partially supported by the [ATOM Accelerator DAO](https://twitter.com/ATOMAccelerator/status/1648703193742974976). Italy has a flourish developer ecosystem which still have to discover Cosmos and the blockchain space in general. Considering that meetups are attended by an average of 50-60 people it's expected that the Hackaton will attract around 100 Developers ready to join the Ecosystem and build something cool.

Here a few links about the past meetups:
