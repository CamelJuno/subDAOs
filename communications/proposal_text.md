- All of the activities described under “Objectives” above.

Core Root members or people with salary from other SubDAOs or other Juno Entities will not get a double salary from this and will participate only for decision-making or as guarantee to the SubDAO good faith.

Quarterly reports will be shared with the community as a recap of operations and results.

## Deployment

In accordance with [Prop 25](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/25), the SubDAO Multisig contract will be instantiated by this governance vote with the Juno community DAO as admin. This means the community can execute messages on behalf of the subDAO via a governance proposal, recall funds back to the community pool, upgrade the contract, or add / remove members.

The Communications subDAO will operate while abiding by the principles defined in [Prop 25](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/proposals/25).

Note, the address of the Juno governance module and community pool is [juno1jv65s3grqf6v6jl3dp4t6c9t9rk99cd83d88wr](https://www.mintscan.io/juno/account/juno1jv65s3grqf6v6jl3dp4t6c9t9rk99cd83d88wr).

Juno community will have full visibility of the subDAO spending using DAODAO interface.

No community pool funds are requested at this stage.
